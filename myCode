        Mother Teresa was born in 1910 in Skopje, the capital of the Republic of
        Macedonia. Little is known about her early life, but at a young age, she
        felt a calling to be a nun and serve through helping the poor. At the
        age of 18, she was given permission to join a group of nuns in Ireland.
        After a few months of training, with the Sisters of Loreto, she was then
        given permission to travel to India. She took her formal religious vows
        in 1931 and chose to be named after St Therese of Lisieux – the patron
        saint of missionaries. On her arrival in India, she began by working as
        a teacher; however, the widespread poverty of Calcutta made a deep
        impression on her, and this led to her starting a new order called “The
        Missionaries of Charity”. The primary objective of this mission was to
        look after people, who nobody else was prepared to look after. Mother
        Teresa felt that serving others was a fundamental principle of the
        teachings of Jesus Christ. She often mentioned the saying of Jesus,

          me.”</strong
